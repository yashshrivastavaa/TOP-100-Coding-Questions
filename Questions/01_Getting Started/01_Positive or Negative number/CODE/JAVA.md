# Method 1: Using Brute Force

This method uses Brute Force to check whether a given integer is Positive or Negative.

## INPUT
```Java
class Main
{
  public static void main (String[]args)
  {

    int num = 5;

    //Conditions to check if the number is negative or positive
    if (num > 0)
        System.out.println ("The number is positive");
    else if (num < 0)
        System.out.println ("The number is negative");
    else
        System.out.println ("Zero");
  }
}
```
## OUTPUT
```
The number is positive
```

### Algorithm

This method uses Brute Force to check whether a given integer is Positive or Negative. The Algorithm for the above code is as follows

*   Step 1. Start
*   Step 2. Insert the number.
*   Step 3. If the number is greater than Zero then print “The number is Positive”
*   Step 4: If the number is smaller than zero, then print, “The number is Negative”
*   Step 5. Else print, “The number is Zero”
*   Step 6. Stop
