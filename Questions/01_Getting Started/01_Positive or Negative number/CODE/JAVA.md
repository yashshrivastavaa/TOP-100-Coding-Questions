# Method 1: Using Brute Force

This method uses Brute Force to check whether a given integer is Positive or Negative.

## INPUT
```Java
class Main
{
  public static void main (String[]args)
  {

    int num = 5;

    //Conditions to check if the number is negative or positive
    if (num > 0)
        System.out.println ("The number is positive");
    else if (num < 0)
        System.out.println ("The number is negative");
    else
        System.out.println ("Zero");
  }
}
```
## OUTPUT
```
The number is positive
```

### Algorithm

This method uses Brute Force to check whether a given integer is Positive or Negative. The Algorithm for the above code is as follows

*   Step 1. Start
*   Step 2. Insert the number.
*   Step 3. If the number is greater than Zero then print “The number is Positive”
*   Step 4: If the number is smaller than zero, then print, “The number is Negative”
*   Step 5. Else print, “The number is Zero”
*   Step 6. Stop


# Method 2: Using Nested if-else Statements

This method uses a nested if-else Statements to check whether a given number is Positive or Negative.

## INPUT
```Java
class Main
{
  public static void main (String[]args)
  {

    int num = 5;
     //Condition to check if the number is negative or positive
    if (num >= 0)
    {
        if (num == 0)
            System.out.println ("Zero");
        else
            System.out.println ("The number is positive");
    }
    else
        System.out.println ("The number is negative");

  }
}
```
## OUTPUT
```
The number is positive
```

### Algorithm

This method uses a nested if-else Statements to check whether a given number is Positive or Negative.

*   Step 1 – Start
*   Step 2 – Insert the number.
*   Step 3 – If the number is greater or equal move to the inner nested loop
    *  Step 3.1 – If the number is zero, print Zero
    *  Step 3.2 – Else print The Number is Positive
*   Step 4 – Else the number has to be negative, Print The number is Negative
*   Step 5 – Stop

# Method 3: Using Ternary Operator

This method uses a ternary operator to check whether a number is Positive or Negative.

> Ternary Operator Syntax: 
> ( Condition ) ? ( if True : Action) : ( if False : Action) ;


## INPUT
```Java
class Main
{
  public static void main (String[]args)
  {

    int num = 0;

    //Condition to check if the number is negative or positive

    if (num == 0)
      {
	    System.out.println ("Zero");
      }
      
    else{
        String result = num > 0 ? "The number is positive" : "The number is negative";
        System.out.println (result);
    }
  }
}
```
## OUTPUT
```
Zero
```

### Algorithm

This method uses a ternary operator to check whether a number is Positive or Negative. The Algorithm for the above code is as follows,

*   Step 1 – Start
*   Step 2 – Insert the number.
*   Step 3 – If number is equal to zero, Print Number is Zero
*   Step 4 – Else do following – (num > 0) ? cout << “Positive”: cout << “Negative”;
*   Step 5 – Stop
